### Report

The Smilow Dentistry database streamlines operations by managing patient records, employee data, insurance details, and procedures. Extensive research identified key entities and relationships to optimize scheduling and billing. Continuous updates ensure alignment with evolving needs, enhancing service delivery and productivity.

The initial phase of our "Smilow Dentistry" database design project has been a comprehensive and collaborative effort. We conducted extensive research to understand the dental practice's operations and data needs, forming the foundation for our database design. We identified entities and their associated attributes required for managing patient information, appointments, billing, insurance, and other critical aspects. Additionally, we proposed two valuable features to enhance the database's functionality for "Smilow Dentistry." These features introduce new entities equipped with multiple attributes, facilitating the tracking of Supply and Prescription. Our design also accounts for crucial entity relationships, enabling handling of scheduling, billing, and other essential functions. 

In the development of the Smilow Dentistry Database Solution, our team has meticulously designed and implemented a comprehensive relational database schema tailored to meet the specific needs of Smilow Dentistry. We have also devised various relational algebra queries to extract meaningful insights from the database, ensuring efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Additionally, we have provided additional functionalities such as views, indexes, transactions, and sample transaction scenarios to enhance the usability and performance of the database system.

Our solution encompasses various aspects, including:

Database Schema Design: We have meticulously designed the database schema, considering the entities, relationships, and attributes pertinent to Smilow Dentistry's operations. The schema reflects the complex relationships between patients, medical employees, procedures, payments, prescriptions, and other relevant entities.

Relational Algebra Queries: We have formulated a set of relational algebra queries to facilitate data retrieval and analysis. These queries cover a wide range of scenarios, including patient medication lists, insurance policy details, revenue analysis, procedure statistics, and more.

Additional Functionalities: We have incorporated additional features such as views, indexes, and transactions to enhance the database's functionality, performance, and data integrity. Views provide a convenient way to access aggregated information, while indexes optimize query performance. Transactions ensure the atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties of database operations, thereby maintaining data integrity.

Sample Transaction Scenarios: We have provided sample transaction scenarios to demonstrate the use of transactions in maintaining data consistency and integrity. These scenarios illustrate how transactions can be used to execute multiple database operations as a single unit of processing, ensuring that data remains accurate and consistent even in concurrent access scenarios.

RDBMS Selection and Testing: We have chosen SQLite as the RDBMS for implementing and testing our database solution. SQLite's lightweight nature and compatibility with SQL standards make it suitable for small to medium-scale applications like Smilow Dentistry.

Overall, our Smilow Dentistry Database Solution aims to provide a robust, efficient, and user-friendly platform for managing patient records, appointments, procedures, payments, and other related data. With careful consideration of database design principles, relational algebra queries, additional functionalities, and transaction management, we believe our solution meets the requirements and expectations of Smilow Dentistry, facilitating smooth and efficient dental practice management.
